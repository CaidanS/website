				<h2>Brothers Karamazov: An Exploration of Freedom</h2>

	<p> Is freedom the root of true happiness? In his 1880 opus The Brothers Karamazov, Fyodor Dostoevsky does not shy away from this question, or its sometimes morbid conclusions. Throughout the novel, various forms of freedom are explored in depth, as well as their inherent contradictions with one another. Of these diverse representations, however, three stand above the rest as intrinsic to the events of the novel, and as such to the human experience as a whole. Through truth, morality, and religion, Dostoevsky seems to argue a very fine point: freedom, while enticing, must be approached with caution, and seems to be the root of true happiness (Nota Bene: Dostoevsky writes as a “sub-author” from a provincial village during the novel, and may be poking fun at the views such a character may hold). </p><br><p>
	The first freedom to display itself in the novel is that of religion and love. Within the deeply religious setting of the book, these two topics seemed to have entwined themselves intractably, and so one cannot address a singular expression of these freedoms without also becoming entrapped by their inter-relationship. The source of this entwinement is that of the church. Explored throughout the novel is the theme of true love’s separation from the auspices of religion. Even within the confines of Christainity, some believe that the church works against true love at the human level. The love of Christ is repeatedly separated from that of the church by various characters. This separation is indicative of a desire for freedom from religious confines, and a freedom of love originating in the individual. </p><br>
	<p> This desire for freedom is expressed most fully by Alyosha, one of the titular Brothers Karamazov. Portrayed as an innocent and childlike, Alyosha gives the reader an ideal view of what a human without undue influence needs to be happy. In this way, Alyosha’s character serves as a litmus test of sorts for true human desire. As a primarily happy and carefree individual, he has been able to achieve happiness for himself in many arenas, the most obvious of which is that of religion and love. </p><br>
<p> Alyosha is first introduced as a so-called “holy fool” who has retained his humanity from his secular family. Not having given up himself to religion fully, he is in a unique position to admire the construct of religion critically from within. Indeed, he finds himself in perhaps the least free position within the Russian church: that of mentee to one of the church elders. This institution of elders is examined at length during the first section of the book, as the servitude it imposes on the mentees is considered absolute. While not the main focus of this essay, the freedom from the self that this arrangement provides is another major theme of the novel as a whole, and is explored later during the chapter on the Grand Inquisitor. As a mentee, Alyosha works within the system of religion, but via the dying wish of his elder, is thrust out into the world. This release from formal religion does not weaken his love, however, but seems to strengthen it. Indeed, Alyosha only seems to experience true love of God after being released from his servitude to formalized to religion. This revelation of true love of God separated from religion against points towards the importance of freedom as it relates to love. This is stated even more explicitly later in the novel by another character, who says that one should love “without reason” (353), using Alyosha as an example of this true form of love, unhindered by outside motivation. As true love is considered the root of happiness within the novel, the freedom to love without exterior motivation is thus essential to true happiness. </p><br>
<p> The next source of freedom comes in the form of freedom from morality. Throughout the novel, characters begin to lose what little morality they began with. As morality is a social construction, this loss of morality constitutes a freedom from societal standards, and a further acceptance of the self. As one is able to shed the constraints of social fictions, one’s individual nature is able to evolve towards something more true to the self, and through this process closer to self-realization. Again, Alyosha provides a perfect example of this freedom. His descent from strict christianized morality to something more liberal traces its path through his interactions with those more base than himself. Through these interactions, one can see the happiness which this formerly constrained individual has attained through freedom from morality. In the final chapters, Alyosha learns to free himself from society's standards and work according to his own standards and relationships, even going so far as to consider bribery (764), an act considered morally repugnant by his former Christian order. This liberation comes at a point when Alyosha has fully accepted himself and is at his happiest, furthering this correlation. </p><br>
<p> Beyond societal morals, one must also renounce individual morals on the path to true happiness. In the novel, this renouncement of individual morality is most clearly seen in Dimitri Karamazov, whose retreat from individual morality begins almost immediately. His notorious benders form a central piece of the plot arc of the novel, and during them he completely abandons his own personal morality. Afterwards, he feels extreme guilt, but the happiness he feels during is period of moral disconnection is not lessened in the slightest by these periods of remorse. While this course of action may not be suggestible to the majority, it may be the most effective method of achieving happiness. More so than the substances or actions used to reject one’s moral code, the rejection itself seems to lend Dimitri’s benders their joyous nature. </p><br>
<p> Finally, the rejection of overall truth constitutes the final step towards true happiness. Similarly to Dimitri’s rejection of morality, this rejection of the truth can be seen in another Karamazovian. Ivan’s rejection of Truth clearly coincides with his most emotional moments of intense rapture. As he descends towards inevitable madness, Ivan frees himself from the idea of a universal truth. While he “return[ed] [God] the ticket” (245), Ivan’s world view is still fundamentally shaped by the religious Truth that he is rebelling against. When he rejects this worldview in favor of madness, he has essentially rejected the Truth in the most efficient manner. Ivan is not always happy after this rejection, but this depression seems to be a transitional state of sorts for the eldest Karamazov brother. Another rejection of Truth comes in the form of Stinking Lizaveta, a holy fool who has rejected any overall Truth in favor of living completely in the moment, a course of action which leads many to consider her insane. Despite this perceived insanity, Lizaveta is widely seen as a truly happy individual, and having discarded her religion, morality and overall truth is one of the only characters to achieve true happiness. While the transition to this sense of total freedom may be dramatic and possibly traumatic, the other side is a carefree sense of happiness which permeates the entire soul. Once again, this freedom remains similar to that of moral freedom, in the sense that not everyone should pursue this source of happiness as it is inherently destructive to society as a whole.
Finally, the topic of freedom as a whole is addressed directly in the chapter The Grand Inquisitor. The inclusion of this chapter is something of a must when discussing freedom, but can be summed up in a brief paragraph for the purposes of this essay. In short, the chapter sees Ivan relating a poem to Alyosha. This poem finds Jesus opposed by the titular inquisitor, who argues that freedom is directly competitive to happiness among the majority of humans, and as such should be eliminated. As this poem is related as a critic of the inquisitor’s viewpoints it serves mainly as further evidence for the importance of freedom to happiness. </p><br>
<p> Dostoevsky seems to be arguing in this book towards the importance of freedom in relation to happiness. This concept of freedom takes on many forms throughout the novel, including most apparently freedom from religion, morality, and finally truth itself. While these sources of freedom may give the characters happiness within the novels, the consequences of their happiness at the highest level seem to be working against the good of society as a whole. As such, one should not strive to emulate these forms of happiness, but rather take them as valuable and informative examples of what can create happiness. Perhaps moderation is key in the pursuit of happiness as well. </p><br>
